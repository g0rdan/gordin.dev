### **MGM Resorts, Las Vegas, NV  (US) - Senior Flutter Engineer (remote)**

04/2021 – present

MGM resort app is been used by over a half-million users every month. It is written entirely on Flutter. As a member of the mobile team, I was assigned at first to the Platform Squad where I was responsible for generic issues, working with native platforms, fixing bugs, tracking and improving performance, etc. Later I was assigned to the Arrival and Departures team where the main responsibility was supporting the current check-in user’s flow (including working with Digital Keys) and rewriting this flow to an entirely new one.
The app has over 80% test coverage, including Unit, Golden, and Integration tests. The primary architectural approach is BLoC with the bloc library. CI/CD - Github Actions. I’m also the sole owner of another MGM app - the Key Encoder. This app lives only on a limited amount of Android tablets at MGM properties. These tablets allow clients to write data by NFC on physical keys to use them for room unlocking.
