Hey, I'm Denis! Nice to meet you!

I'm a software developer focused on mobile development. Since 2019 I've been working with Flutter and Dart. Before that, starting from 2014, I was working with Xamarin. You might notice that I'm a big fan of cross-platform development ðŸ˜…

I'm husband and father of one. I love spending time with my family!

I also collect handhelds! I have a weird love for small electronic devices, and if those devices can run games, even better!
