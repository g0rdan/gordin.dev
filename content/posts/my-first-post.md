## Introduction

It is going to be a weird first post in my blog but I always wanted to have a place where I can share my thoughts and ideas. In fact, I'm not quite sure do I want to share it with an audience or just keep it for myself, to reflect on it, in a way? I guess I will see how it goes.

I definitely want to use this blog as a reflection point. I also want to have a place where I can journal a something that is bigger than a tweet but smaller than a book.

It is a lot of "water" here already, but I have something concrete in mind already for this blog. I'd like to record my journey on creating a video game! Video games are big part of myself even if I don't play them much anymore. I know almost nothing about creating a video game but I'm excited to learn and share my journey with you, potential reader. I have some ideas on what type of game I want to create, what technologies and engines I want to try and so on, but I will keep it for the next post. In the next post I'll try to unfold my ideas and reflect on what I actually want to do with the game.

So, stay tuned! I hope you will enjoy the journey with me!
