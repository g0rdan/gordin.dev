## The plan

It's been a while since I wrote my first post. I've been thinking about how I want to approach the game development. I have some ideas and I want to share them with you.

### Disclaimer

I'm a husband and father of a toddler, and also have a regular job, and believe me or not, it is quite challenging to find a time for a hobby. So, it is my attempt to define some kind of a plan to keep myself on track. I can't put real dates for deadlines, but I can put some milestones and try to keep up with them.

### The technology

I'm mobile developer by profession. To be even more specific, I'm a Flutter developer. I love this framework and obvious choice for me is to try the [Flame engine](https://flame-engine.org). To be honest, 5(!) years ago I dipped my toes into this engine and created a clone of [Flappy Bird](https://github.com/g0rdan/Flutter.Bird) and this is how I felt in love with Flutter, in general. It was a long time ago and, frankly, I don't remember much about Flame.

I also really want to try Godot engine. I've heard a lot of good things about it. But as for right now, I want to stick with Flame because I believe it is much simpler engine and I hope I'll learn from it more about Flutter itself, which obviously will be useful for my daily job.

### The game(s)

I, as many other dev out there, have bad habit of starting a project and never finishing it. I want to break this habit. For that, as a first step, I should pick a small game that I can finish in a reasonable time, and I have exactly that in mind.

I'll create a clone of [2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game))!

The main objectives for this game are:

- Finish the game. It will be as close to the original as possible.
- Dive into Flame engine, learn it.
- I want to see how crossplatform aspect of it will perform. Especially on web, since the latest Flutter version added full WASM support.

Let's say I'll finish this game in summer of this year. I know it is quite a long time, but I want to be realistic with all other responsibilities I have.

The second game I have in mind is a "bit" more complex. I want to create a [tower defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense) game!
It will be much more complex than 2048. It would require some other aspects of game development, like graphics and design, sound, and so on. I definitely won't be able to finish it in this year, but hopefully I'll have some alpha version by the end of next year. I believe I have very unique idea and setting for this game though, so I'm very excited about it.

Wish me luck!
